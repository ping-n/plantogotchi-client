# Plantogotochi
---

This is a team project created for the final assessment during the Coder Academy bootcamp. For this assessment we had one week for planning and less than two week to code. We had to create a React App with a Ruby on Rails backend.

Plantogotchi took inspiration from Tamagotchi giving users the ability to grow plants from a little seedling to a fully grown plant.
